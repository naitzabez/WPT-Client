WPT Signup Application - Q/A

Q: What is WPT Signup Application?
A: WPT Signup is an application used to signup for raids. It also has additional features to make things easier.

Q: Why should we use this over google docks?
A: The application makes it easier to find available raids, it eases work for officers as the server will process the information. 
   You can also see more stuff such as piecharts, diagrams & sorted lists etc. 

Q: Speaking of server, who's hosting it?
A: The server is being hosted by me (Sebbe) on a Raspberry PI3.

Q: Actually what is a server? No joke.. 
A: A server is just a computer (just like your pc or mobile phone) that multiple people can access.

Q: What information does the server store?
A: The server stores login data of all users (username & password), characters of of all users & data for raid events.
(IMPORTANT: Use simple "throw-away" passwords, i don't want to be accused of account theft just because you used your "real" password that 
you use for other applications such as Email or WoW. For example abc123 or something silly).

Q: Is anything stored client side?
A: No, everything is stored server side. This makes it so i can release a new client version without screwing up stored data. 
   You can also login to accounts of friends if they want you to sign up their characters. 
(IMPORTANT: Might include autofill from file on client side in the future).

Q: What else can you see?
A: In the server UI i can see:                REASON:
  I)  If a user is logged in/out.             - (debug information/stat)
 II)  What server is looking for from user    - (debug information/stat)
III)  Your IP adress                          - (used as key for hashmap access server side so server can send data to individual users)
 IV)  Amount of users currently connected     - (debug information/stat)  
  V)  Server uptime                           - (debug information/stat)

Example image of the server UI with two users logged in: https://imgur.com/a/cNdn63U
(IMPORTANT: This information is live information, when a user disconnects the information is lost, nothing is stored). 

Q: But isn't it dangerous that you can see my IP?
A: It's not, it's required to establish a connection
   to the server. 
   For instance, you can see your IP on this site: https://canyouseeme.org/
   (I also used this site when i was working on the server side
    It's a great tool).
    
Q: What language is this application written in? 
A: Java, write once run everywhere. Shouldnt have issues with your OS (tested windows/mac/raspbian so far).
   It built with default java libraries, alot of visual elements are made by me such as buttons & text fields. 

Q: Will a mobile application be released aswell?
A: Most likely not. This would mean that i have to maintain three different clients (pc, android & ios) and the server.
   That's alot of work. However what's more likely is that i scrap the pc client and simply create a website for WPT where
   the signup is one of many features. This would mean that you can do signups from phone and pc. It would also mean that WPT
   now has a website platform that can be built upon, additional features such as guild reqruitment perhaps? 
   If I end up going this route then basically the desktop app will be redundant and no longer be supported. 
   This also means we need to have a seceret key on our discord that's required when a user wants to create an account on the 
   site to prevent outsiders from creating accounts on our site. 

   EX of user create) (discord key = 2415abc44)
   Format             -> [Username] [Password] [Pw repeat] [key] 
   Valid user create  -> [Sebbe   ] [abc123  ] [abc123   ] [2415abc44] SUCCESS ->(key match    )
   Invalid user create-> [Sebbe   ] [abc123  ] [abc123   ] [ff34csew4] ERROR   ->(key missmatch)

   (IMPORTANT: I can implement a keyupdate function server side so that i can generate new keys on the fly if one where to be leaked)

   (IMPORTANT2: If key where to be leaked it's not anything dangerous, it simply allows outsiders to create accounts and sign up for our raids,
   it's just going to be annoying for admins to ban those). 

   (The reason we dont use this format for the pc app is because the link to the github is in the discord so the link is the "key" in itself).
   

Q: How does this application work? 
A: Basically, users (client side) send requests to the server (such as "login [username] [password]", "fetch raid_1 signups", 
   "update raid_1 signups [charactername]" etc (those are not the actual strings being sent, just examples)) 
   and if requests are legal the server will respond to the client with either the data you asked for or a handshake for update confirmation. 

Q: Do i need to create a new user for every character i wish to raid on?
A: No, a single user will have its own file stored server side that contains all their characters. 
Ex)
 **Inside server**
 USER{                    
 File1: username.txt      <- Your Username & password.
 File2: char_username.txt <- ALL your characters.
 }

Q: How many users can the server hold?
A: The cap is hardcoded to 100 users, though, i highly doubt it will ever go above 10 users concurrent. 

Q: If the sever chokes and dies, will all information be lost?
A: No, the server updates files on the fly so basically all data changes are saved immedietly. 
   I simply just have to restart the server. 

Q: Does officers have additional commands that normal users dont have?
A: Yes:
  I) Ban user / Unban user
 II) Create / Remove raid event
III) Accept/Decline raid signups
 IV) Release "official" raid event (when all sign ups are done).
If a users account is flagged as officer their Client will look slightly different (basically additional windows/buttons for the commands).

Q: Actually i don't trust you..
A: The client is a runnable jar file, you can literally extract 
all the files the program consists on and view the source code.
I have to warn you though, the main UI class is 1k+ lines lol..

Q: I've found a bug, who do i report it to?
A: PM Sebbe on discord with detailed information. 

Q: What types of updates can we expect in the future?
A: Mainly bugfixes, prettier UI & perhaps more features if people have suggestions (such as autofill).
   If enough people want it i might develop the WPT site instead and scrap the client entierly.

FYI: Client side fetches raid data every 2-3 sec while in menu, it also fetches raid data when any "back" button is pressed.
