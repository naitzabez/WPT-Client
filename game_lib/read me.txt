WPT Client - Server testing / early release

In this version you can:
{
	Create a user
	Add characters to that user / Delete characters
	Sign up for raids / remove signup
	View confirmed players
	View confirmed players by graphs/piecharts
}

What you cannot do:
{
	Confirm players (admin feature not yet implemented)
	Create/delete raid events (admin feature not yet implemented)
	Ban/unban users (admin feature not yet implemented)
}

NOTE: When you sign a character to a raid they wont be confirmed. 
      This means that you will not see your signed up characters 
      inside Raid Confirms or Raid Overview tab. 
      Also, the characters inside raid confirm/overview are
      characters that I have hard coded in to test those
      features. So dont freak out if your character is on 
      that list, I added them. 

THIS VERSION IS MAINLY FOR SERVER TESTING.
	
What i want tested:
	YOU creating an account and logging in, and sign up for raid.
	Watch the "raid confirms" and "raid overview" tabs.
	Logout

	Wait roughly 1h-2h
	Log back in, see if your data is still there:
		I) Do you have same characters as last session?
		II) Is your character still signed up?

Thank you for testing, pm any bug/freezes of the client to sebbe on discord with detailed information.
